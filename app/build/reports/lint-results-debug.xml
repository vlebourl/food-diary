        explanation="FragmentContainerView replaces the &lt;fragment> tag as the preferred                 way of adding fragments via XML. Unlike the &lt;fragment> tag, FragmentContainerView                 uses a normal `FragmentTransaction` under the hood to add the initial fragment,                 allowing further FragmentTransaction operations on the FragmentContainerView                 and providing a consistent timing for lifecycle events."
