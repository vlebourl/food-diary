# Feature Specification: IBS Food & Symptom Tracking Application

**Feature Branch**: `002-let-s-build`
**Created**: 2025-09-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "let's build an android application to help me track my food, coffee and other drink habits, as well as my digestive state, the point being to help diagnose a possible IBS. I want to be able to do several things, but this list is not exhaustive! i want to be able to add a coffee with is single button, i want to be able to specify the date and time of a meal or drink or any food or bevarage intake, as well as the quantity, I want the "default" digestive state to be "nothing", like all is well if I don't specify otherwise, I want to be able to add a diahreea event with a single button and also modify date and time if needed, I want to see statistics and trends. From a more general point of view, I want the app to be modern looking, well organized and adhere to the latest standards and best practices of android programming. Let's start by specifying the big picture, we'll go into all the tiny details and features later on."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-24
- Q: For an IBS tracking app dealing with sensitive health data, where should user data primarily reside? ‚Üí A: Local-only storage on device (maximum privacy, no sync)
- Q: What scale should be used for rating symptom severity? ‚Üí A: 1-10 scale (medical standard, more granular)
- Q: How far back should users be able to log missed entries? ‚Üí A: Unlimited (any date in past)
- Q: Which items should have default quick-add buttons at launch? ‚Üí A: None (user configures all in settings)
- Q: What format should medical reports be exported in? ‚Üí A: PDF and JSON formats

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As someone with potential IBS, I want a comprehensive tracking system for my dietary intake and symptom patterns so that I can identify patterns, triggers, and correlations to better manage my condition and provide detailed information to my healthcare provider.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I consume various foods and beverages throughout the day, **When** I log entries, **Then** I can capture complete nutritional intake with timestamps, quantities, and ingredients
2. **Given** I experience digestive symptoms, **When** I record them, **Then** I can specify type, severity, duration, timing, and potential triggers
3. **Given** I haven't logged any symptoms, **When** the system evaluates my state, **Then** it maintains a baseline "normal" digestive status
4. **Given** I have accumulated tracking data, **When** I view analytics, **Then** I see meaningful patterns, correlations, and potential trigger foods
5. **Given** I frequently consume certain items or experience common symptoms, **When** I access the app, **Then** I have customizable quick-entry options for efficient logging
6. **Given** I need to share my data with healthcare providers, **When** I generate reports, **Then** I receive professionally formatted, medically relevant summaries
7. **Given** I'm trying to follow an elimination diet, **When** I use the app, **Then** I can track reintroduction phases and reactions
8. **Given** I want to understand my condition better, **When** I explore the app, **Then** I have access to insights about symptom timing, food sensitivities, and lifestyle factors
9. **Given** I need historical context, **When** I review past entries, **Then** I can search, filter, and edit my tracking history
10. **Given** I'm logging entries throughout the day, **When** I use the app, **Then** the interface is fast, intuitive, and minimizes data entry effort

### Edge Cases
- How does the system handle incomplete meal entries (unknown ingredients)?
- What happens with contradictory symptom reports for the same timeframe?
- How are multi-day symptoms tracked (ongoing issues)?
- How does the app handle food consumed over extended periods (grazing)?
- What if users need to track non-food triggers (stress, exercise, medications)?
- How are combination foods handled (recipes with multiple ingredients)?
- What about tracking eating behaviors (speed of eating, meal environment)?
- How does the system manage data conflicts when editing historical entries affects pattern analysis?
