## Overview
This quickstart validates the complete food diary UI implementation through user story scenarios.

## Prerequisites
- Android device or emulator (API 26+)
- App installed with existing database schema
- Test data generator available
- All 6 main screens implemented

## Validation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First-Time User Experience
**Goal**: Verify empty state handling and initial user guidance

```
Steps:
1. Launch app with empty database
2. Navigate to Timeline screen
3. Verify empty state message: "Add your first entry"
4. Tap FAB to add food entry
5. Complete food entry form with:
   - Meal Type: Lunch
   - Foods: ["Rice", "Chicken"]
   - Portions: ["1 cup", "100g"]
   - Current timestamp
6. Save entry
7. Return to timeline
8. Verify entry appears with proper formatting

Expected Results:
✅ Empty state UI displays guidance
✅ Food entry form validation works
✅ Entry saves successfully to database
✅ Timeline updates with new entry
✅ Visual formatting follows Material Design 3
```

### Scenario 2: Symptom Correlation Workflow
**Goal**: Test the complete food-to-symptom correlation process

```
Steps:
1. Add food entry at timestamp T
2. Wait or adjust timestamp to T+2 hours
3. Navigate to Symptom Entry screen
4. Select symptom type: Nausea
5. Set severity: 7/10
6. Verify potential triggers show recent food entry
7. Select the food entry as trigger
8. Add notes: "Started 2 hours after lunch"
9. Save symptom entry
10. Return to timeline
11. Verify correlation indicator shows between entries

Expected Results:
✅ Symptom form loads recent food entries
✅ Correlation calculation works within time window
✅ Visual correlation indicators display
✅ Database correlation record created
✅ Timeline shows linked entries
```

### Scenario 3: Analytics Dashboard
**Goal**: Validate pattern visualization and insights

```
Steps:
1. Generate test data: 30 food entries, 15 symptom events over 2 weeks
2. Ensure some correlations exist
3. Navigate to Analytics screen
4. Verify overview statistics display
5. Check correlation timeline chart
6. Review symptom trends section
7. Examine top trigger foods list
8. Change time range to "Last Week"
9. Verify all charts update correctly

Expected Results:
✅ Overview stats calculate correctly
✅ Charts render with proper data
✅ Correlation visualizations work
✅ Time range filtering functions
✅ Performance acceptable with test dataset
✅ Handles insufficient data gracefully
```

### Scenario 4: Report Generation
**Goal**: Test healthcare provider report creation

```
Steps:
1. Ensure sufficient test data (minimum 7 days)
2. Navigate to Reports screen
3. Select "Monthly" report type
4. Choose "Medical" template
5. Select PDF format
6. Generate report
7. Verify generation progress indicator
8. Open generated report
9. Validate report contains:
   - Executive summary
   - Correlation analysis
   - Charts and visualizations
   - Appropriate medical disclaimers

Expected Results:
✅ Report generation completes successfully
✅ PDF format renders correctly
✅ All required sections present
✅ Charts embedded properly
✅ File sharing functionality works
✅ Insufficient data shows placeholders with generic messages
```

### Scenario 5: Settings Configuration
**Goal**: Verify comprehensive preferences management

```
Steps:
1. Navigate to Settings screen
2. Update correlation time window to 6 hours
3. Add custom symptom type: "Fatigue"
4. Enable daily reminder notifications
5. Change measurement units to Imperial
6. Set data retention to 24 months
7. Update export format to CSV
8. Save all changes
9. Restart app
10. Verify all settings persisted

Expected Results:
✅ All setting categories accessible
✅ Input validation prevents invalid values
✅ Changes persist after app restart
✅ UI reflects preference updates
✅ Correlation window affects trigger detection
✅ Custom symptoms appear in entry forms
```

### Scenario 6: Data Export/Import
**Goal**: Test backup and restore functionality

```
Steps:
1. Create diverse test data (food entries, symptoms, correlations)
2. Navigate to Settings > Data Management
3. Export all data to JSON format
4. Save export file to device storage
5. Clear all app data (or use fresh install)
6. Import the exported JSON file
7. Verify all data restored correctly:
   - Timeline entries match
   - Correlations preserved
   - Settings restored
   - Analytics recalculate correctly

Expected Results:
✅ Export completes without errors
✅ Export file contains all necessary data
✅ Import process succeeds
✅ All data integrity maintained
✅ Correlation patterns preserved
✅ User preferences restored
```

## Performance Validation

### Scenario 7: Maximum Data Load
**Goal**: Test app performance with constitutional limits

```
Steps:
1. Generate maximum test data:
   - 365 days × 50 entries = 18,250 entries
   - ~50% split between food and symptoms
   - Realistic correlation patterns
2. Launch app and measure:
   - App startup time
   - Timeline scroll performance
   - Analytics calculation time
   - Database query response times
3. Verify all constitutional constraints met

Expected Results:
✅ App launch < 2 seconds
✅ UI operations < 16ms (60fps)
✅ Database queries < 100ms
✅ Memory usage < 100MB
✅ Storage usage < 20MB
✅ All 50 entries/day limit enforced
```

## Error Handling Validation

### Scenario 8: Edge Cases and Errors
**Goal**: Verify robust error handling

```
Steps:
1. Test invalid inputs:
   - Empty food entry
   - Future timestamps
   - Invalid portion formats
   - Severity out of range (0, 11)
2. Simulate low storage conditions
3. Test database corruption recovery
4. Attempt oversized data export
5. Test network-less operation

Expected Results:
✅ Input validation prevents invalid data
✅ Error messages are user-friendly
✅ App gracefully handles storage limits
✅ Database recovery mechanisms work
✅ Offline functionality maintained
✅ No crashes or data loss
```

## Acceptance Criteria

All scenarios must pass with these requirements:
- ✅ Constitutional compliance (privacy, accuracy, integrity, offline-first, TDD)
- ✅ Material Design 3 visual consistency
- ✅ Performance targets met
- ✅ Accessibility standards followed
- ✅ Test coverage > 80% for business logic
- ✅ All user stories from spec.md validated

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Correlation not showing**: Check time window settings and data timestamps
2. **Charts not rendering**: Verify sufficient data points for visualization
3. **Export failures**: Check storage permissions and available space
4. **Performance issues**: Validate data pruning and indexing strategies

### Debug Tools
- Enable debug logging for correlation calculations
- Use database inspector for data validation
- Monitor memory usage during large operations
- Check analytics calculation intermediate results

## Next Steps
After quickstart validation passes:
1. Run automated test suite
2. Perform accessibility audit
3. Execute performance profiling
4. Validate against constitutional checklist
5. Prepare for production release
