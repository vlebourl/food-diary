# Research & Technical Decisions

## Architecture Decisions

### **Decision**: MVVM with Repository Pattern
**Rationale**:
- Aligns with Android Architecture Components best practices
- Separates UI logic from business logic for testability
- Repository pattern provides clean data abstraction layer
- ViewModels survive configuration changes
- Supports reactive data flow with LiveData/StateFlow

**Alternatives considered**:
- MVP: More boilerplate, tight coupling between View and Presenter
- MVI: More complex state management, overkill for this feature scope

### **Decision**: Room Database with SQLite
**Rationale**:
- Already integrated in existing codebase
- Offline-first architecture requirement
- Type-safe database access
- Built-in migration support
- Excellent testing utilities

**Alternatives considered**:
- Raw SQLite: More error-prone, no compile-time checks
- Realm: Additional dependency, not part of Android Jetpack

### **Decision**: Navigation Component
**Rationale**:
- Already integrated in existing project
- Type-safe navigation with SafeArgs
- Handles fragment transactions automatically
- Built-in deep linking support
- Consistent navigation patterns

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual fragment transactions: Error-prone, complex state management
- Third-party navigation: Additional dependency overhead

### **Decision**: Material Design 3 Theming
**Rationale**:
- Already established in existing theme configuration
- Consistent with modern Android design guidelines
- Built-in accessibility support
- Dynamic theming capabilities
- Extensive component library

**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom theming: More development time, accessibility challenges
- Material Design 2: Legacy approach, limited theming options

## UI Component Decisions

### **Decision**: Fragment-based Architecture
**Rationale**:
- Existing navigation graph already defines fragment destinations
- Better memory management for complex screens
- Easier testing with Fragment scenarios
- Supports multiple screen sizes and orientations

**Alternatives considered**:
- Single Activity with Composables: Major architecture change, existing codebase uses fragments
- Multiple Activities: Poor performance, complex navigation

### **Decision**: ViewBinding for Layout Access
**Rationale**:
- Type-safe view references
- Null-safe by design
- Lightweight compared to DataBinding
- Good performance characteristics

**Alternatives considered**:
- findViewById: Not type-safe, prone to runtime errors
- DataBinding: Overkill for this feature, adds compilation complexity

## Data Flow Decisions

### **Decision**: Repository Pattern with Coroutines
**Rationale**:
- Clean separation between data sources
- Async operations with structured concurrency
- Easy testing with TestDispatchers
- Cancellation support for lifecycle-aware operations

**Alternatives considered**:
- RxJava: Additional learning curve, more complex threading model
- Callbacks: Callback hell, difficult error handling

### **Decision**: StateFlow for UI State Management
**Rationale**:
- Lifecycle-aware updates
- Hot stream with initial value
- Thread-safe by design
- Easy testing with TestScope

**Alternatives considered**:
- LiveData: Limited operators, not lifecycle-aware in ViewModels
- Flow with collectAsState: More complex setup, potential memory leaks

## Testing Strategy Decisions

### **Decision**: JUnit 5 + Mockk + Room Testing
**Rationale**:
- JUnit 5 provides modern testing features and better assertions
- Mockk integrates well with Kotlin features
- Room testing utilities support in-memory database testing
- Espresso for UI testing provides reliable interaction testing

**Alternatives considered**:
- JUnit 4: Limited features, older assertion style
- Mockito: Less Kotlin-friendly, more verbose syntax

## Performance Optimization Decisions

### **Decision**: RecyclerView with DiffUtil
**Rationale**:
- Efficient list updates with minimal redraws
- Built-in animation support
- Memory efficient for large datasets
- Easy implementation with ListAdapter

**Alternatives considered**:
- ListView: Deprecated, poor performance
- Manual list management: Error-prone, poor performance

### **Decision**: Repository Caching Strategy
**Rationale**:
- In-memory caching for frequently accessed data
- Database as single source of truth
- Reactive updates propagate automatically

**Alternatives considered**:
- No caching: Poor performance, excessive database queries
- Complex multi-level caching: Overkill for current scope

## Conclusion

All technical decisions align with:
- Constitutional principles (privacy, accuracy, testability, data integrity, offline-first)
- Android development best practices
- Existing project architecture
- Performance and scalability requirements

No additional research required - ready for Phase 1 design.
