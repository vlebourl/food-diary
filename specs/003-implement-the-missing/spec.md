# Feature Specification: Core Food Diary UI Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `003-implement-the-missing`
**Created**: 2025-01-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement the missing UI components and core functionality for the food diary app. The app currently has only placeholder fragments - need to build actual screens for: 1. Timeline view showing chronological food entries and symptoms 2. Food entry form with ingredient input, portion tracking, and timestamp 3. Symptom logging with severity scale, type selection, and correlation tracking 4. Analytics dashboard displaying food-symptom patterns and insights 5. Reports generation for healthcare provider sharing 6. Settings for user preferences and data management Focus on Material Design 3 UI following existing theme, Room database integration for persistence, and intuitive UX for daily logging workflow."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-25
- Q: What is the correlation time window for linking symptoms to food entries? → A: User configurable with 2-4 hours as default
- Q: What specific user preference categories should the settings screen include? → A: Comprehensive (units, notifications, correlation window, data retention, privacy controls, export formats) and Medical-focused (correlation settings, symptom categories, trigger alerts, report templates)
- Q: What data backup and restore capabilities should the system support? → A: Export/import files (JSON, CSV format for manual backup) - Note: Cloud backup (Google Drive, iCloud) for future consideration
- Q: What are the maximum data limits the system should handle? → A: Light usage (50 entries/day, 1 year retention, ~20MB storage)
- Q: What should happen when users try to generate reports with insufficient data? → A: Show existing data with generic error where missing

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users with digestive health concerns need to track their daily food intake and symptoms to identify patterns that help diagnose potential IBS or food sensitivities. They log meals, record symptoms, and view analysis to share with healthcare providers for informed medical decisions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** no previous entries, **When** user opens the timeline, **Then** they see an empty state with guidance to add their first entry
2. **Given** the food entry form is open, **When** user inputs meal details with ingredients and portions, **Then** the entry is saved with timestamp and appears in timeline
3. **Given** user experiences digestive symptoms, **When** they log symptom details with severity rating, **Then** the system correlates it with recent food entries
4. **Given** multiple entries exist, **When** user views analytics dashboard, **Then** they see visual patterns between foods and symptoms over time
5. **Given** user wants to share data, **When** they generate a report, **Then** system creates a healthcare-provider-ready summary of patterns and correlations
6. **Given** user wants to customize experience, **When** they access settings, **Then** they can modify preferences for notifications, data retention, and measurement units

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user tries to log a symptom but has no recent food entries to correlate with?
- How does system handle duplicate food entries logged at similar times?
- What occurs when user attempts to generate reports with insufficient data? → System displays available data and shows generic placeholder messages for missing analysis sections
- How does system behave when user enters invalid portion sizes or severity ratings?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display chronological timeline of all food entries and symptoms with clear visual distinction
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to create food entries with ingredient lists, portion sizes, and timestamps
- **FR-003**: System MUST enable users to log symptoms with type selection, severity scale (1-10), duration, and optional notes
- **FR-004**: System MUST automatically correlate symptoms with recent food entries within a user-configurable time window (default: 2-4 hours)
- **FR-005**: System MUST display analytics showing patterns between specific foods and symptoms over time
- **FR-006**: System MUST generate exportable reports summarizing user's food-symptom patterns for healthcare providers, displaying available data with generic placeholder messages when insufficient data exists for complete analysis
- **FR-007**: System MUST persist all user data locally on device for offline access
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide comprehensive settings including measurement units, notification preferences, correlation time windows, data retention periods, privacy controls, export formats, symptom categories, trigger alerts, and report templates
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate user input including: portion sizes matching acceptable formats (numeric with units), severity ratings within 1-10 range, timestamps not in future, and required fields not empty
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide navigation between all screens with maximum 3 taps to reach any feature, following Material Design 3 navigation patterns
- **FR-011**: System MUST support data export/import capabilities in JSON and CSV formats for manual backup and restore
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle up to 50 entries per day with 1 year data retention within 20MB storage limit

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **FoodEntry**: Represents a meal or snack with timestamp, ingredient list, portion information, meal type, and optional contextual notes
- **SymptomEvent**: Captures digestive symptoms with type classification, severity rating, duration, onset time, and potential trigger correlations
- **UserPreferences**: Stores personalized settings for correlation time windows, notification schedules, measurement units, data retention periods, and interface customizations
- **CorrelationPattern**: Links food entries to subsequent symptom events with confidence ratings and time-based relationships
- **ReportData**: Aggregated summaries of food-symptom patterns formatted for healthcare provider consumption
